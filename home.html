                <h1>Olivia Benson</h1>
                <p>
                    *Swift's first famous cat is a Scottish Fold named Meredith Grey (yes, she is named after Meredith Grey of Grey's Anatomy). The pop star got Meredith in 2011.<br>
                        *The kitten has always had a special place in Swift's heart. "She is awesome. She's, like, the most adorable cat in the world," the singer said not long after bringing her home. <br>
                        *Their relationship, however, is not one-sided â€” Swift has a loyal fan in Meredith. In 2012, when her then-new single, "I Knew You Were Trouble," was playing on the radio, Swift filmed Meredith meowing along to the song. <br>
                        Meredith has made several appearances on Swift's Instagram and is a bit of a star in her own right as well. Look closely throughout Deadpool 2 to spot Meredith: she appears in a t-shirt Ryan Reynolds' character wears in the film, which shows Meredith and her sister Olivia Benson sitting side-by-side with the words, "Olivia & Meredith Best Friends Purrrrr-Ever.
                        " The Scottish Fold also appeared in Swift's "ME!" music video with Panic! At the Disco. <br>
                        *That said, Meredith might be Swift's most reclusive cat. In 2020, Swift encouraged her fans to self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic with a cute photo of Meredith sitting in a toy, barely visible. 
                        In a tweet, the pop star wrote, "For Meredith, self quarantining is a way of life. Be like Meredith."<br>
